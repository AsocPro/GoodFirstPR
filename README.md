# GoodFirstPR

This is a project that's sole purpose is to provide a low barrier of entry to for first time contributers to go through the process of making a pull request.

# What do I do?

You can add another markdown or text file or anything really. Try to keep things organized nicely and I may give some feedback on these things but for the most part I don't care what you want to submit. If you need inspiration maybe you could add some ascii art or a quote that you like. 

Also feel free to create issues if you would like to try that out as well The entire goal of this repository is to be a place for learning.

For more information on creating pull requests if you need a little more help then you can see this doc here: [https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request
